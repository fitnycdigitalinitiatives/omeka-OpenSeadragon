OpenSeadragon plugin for Omeka
===

**!!MDID Compatibility!!**

If upgrading the underlying Open Seadragon js file be sure to remove the following line of code so that it is compatible with MDID, which does not have file extensions in the url for images (thus will break Seadragon):

`&& (
                file.url.toLowerCase().match(/^.*\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif)(?:\?.*)?$/) || (
                    file.mimetype &&
                    file.mimetype.toLowerCase().match(/^.*\/(png|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/)
                )
            )`

This is a plugin for [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) 2.x that adds an zoomable
image viewer provided by [OpenSeadragon](http://openseadragon.github.io),
usable on item pages, exhibits, and the Omeka admin dashboard.

This plugin was originally based on the [ZoomIt plugin](https://github.com/omeka/plugin-Zoomit)
for Omeka, and the fork of that plugin used in the
[DPLA Exhibitions](https://github.com/dpla/exhibitions) codebase.

Has been updated by FIT with latest version of OpenSeadragon, and tailored more specifically to our needs.

**Requirements**

* Omeka 2.0 or higher
* The `gd` (recommended) and/or the `exif` modules for PHP

**How it works**

Omeka uses ImageMagick to generate derivatives of any image added. For
example, if you have an high resolution JPEG image, it will treat that image
as the "original", and derive "fullsize" (medium resolution) images and
thumbnails automatically.

The OpenSeadragon plugin uses OpenSeadragon's support for
["legacy image pyramids"](http://openseadragon.github.io/examples/tilesource-legacy/)
to pull in those original, fullsize, and thumbnail images from Omeka. Since
OpenSeadragon requires the image size to be stated explicitly for images in
any image pyramid, we need to obtain the dimensions from each of the files,
either through metadata stored in the Omeka database for each file, or through
using either `gd` or `exif` functions.

To manually embed viewer (for better placement), use <?php echo $this->openseadragon($item->Files); ?> in item show page.

**Known issues:**

Only works with original images in formats supported by OpenSeadragon's
LegacyTileSource class (JPEG, GIF, and PNG). Specifically, this impacts you
if you're using high resolution images in TIFF or JPEG 2000 (JP2) format.
If you want to load high resolution versions of these, you'll need to convert
them to a supported format or only rely on the `fullsize` and `thumbnail`
sizes.
